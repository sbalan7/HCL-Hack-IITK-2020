# Dynamic Malware Analysis with Machine Learning

The Dynamic data provided in the dataset was split into two categories. Despite the very large size of the dataset, there were few crucial feature vectors in the json files provided which give high classification accuracy. These feature vectors were extracted in the file `dynamic_model_building.py` and exported to a csv file. In the same file, a random forest was grown and used as the model to predict classes for the dynamic malware classification problem. The model achieves a train accuracy of  and accuracy of  on a holdout validation set. The dynamic analysis model is then loaded into the final malware detection file for classification of unseen test set. 

 fforts were taken to make the code platform independent with the use of the `os` library. The `dynamic_data_extract()` function reads the json file provided with the `json` library. It extracts data vectors from the file and stores it in a Pandas `DataFrame` object. This function is called over and over to recieve a dataline for prediction, which is then passed on the model. The model itself was a Random Forest Classifier with the `scikit-learn` implementation.
